# What languages/frameworks I used?

 Java and Javafx. Sqlite for the database
 
# How to use it? 

You can use it with most java framework like Intellij Idea. Once opened with the ide just play run in "Main" (if you never used javafx in your computer it can be a long process to install it etc..)

# What I've learned?

MVVM - model - view - view model. How to use java in a professional way and applicate object oriented concepts. Many different design pattern like command and memento pattern for restoring the last actions, and DAO (data access object) pattern for connecting the database and doing request in order to save everything in the database.
